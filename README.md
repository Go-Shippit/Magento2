## Installation

### Magento Marketplace (recommended)
The Magento Marketplace is the recommended method of installing this module for Merchants - this GitHub repo is merely a mirror of the changes we submit to the Marketplace, albeit the marketplace may be a version or two behind while we await for update approvals from the Magento Marketplace Quality Assurance Team.

Goto https://marketplace.magento.com/shippit-shipping.html to install this module via the Magento Marketplace

### Composer Installation

*Note: Installation of the module via composer should be completed by a developer or someone comfortable with composer and the server commandline - we suggest testing this installation on a staging instance before pushing this live*

To install this module via composer, simply run the following commands from your server shell

```
composer require shippit/magento2
```

Once the package has been installed, proceed with the standard Magento module installation instructions, such as running the setup scripts, di compilation and static asset compilation

This will fetch and install the latest version of the Magento 2 module, as referenced in the master branch.

### Manual File Upload
